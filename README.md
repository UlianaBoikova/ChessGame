â€¢	Chess

Chess is a fairly basic game, but it really develops your understanding of classes, inheritance, and, in general, your object-oriented programming skills. I wrote it in JavaFX, and I think it was a great learning experience.
In this game, the player can only move their pieces according to the rules, as any other input will not trigger the pieces.
For the opponent, I created a small artificial intelligence: first, it checks whether any piece is in danger, naturally, in order of importance (first the king, then the queen, etc.), then it checks whether it is possible to remove any of the opponent's pieces (also in order of importance), and then, if none of this is possible, it simply chooses a piece that can move.
The game ends when one side loses its king.
